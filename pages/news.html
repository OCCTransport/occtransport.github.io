						Due to increased traffic during class change times, certain WS, DCL, MS & UDC Inbound runs will begin skipping Academic A upon entering campus by servicing the Union via East Drive instead

					Welcome to the Fall 2024 Semester, Bearcats! OCC Transport is happy to be back running full service with some improvements and additions to service for you this semester. <br> <br>

					OCCT is proud to introduce a new route, the Downtown Southside (DS)! This route provides service between Main Campus and the UDC via Southside neighborhoods and Downtown Binghamton. This semester, it will only run in the Outbound direction (Campus to UDC) in the evening hours when BC Transit stops operating the 5. As we increase staffing levels and review passenger demand, a mirrored Inbound run will begin operating in the following semesters. Visit occtransport.org/pages/ds for more information!

					<br> <br> <b>Since the release of the Downtown Southside, we will no longer be operating the Leroy Southside (LRS). </b>Being the oldest route in our roster, operating since the early 1990s, this route’s service area is currently covered by other routes throughout our service hours and therefore defunct.  

					<br> <br> Since our staffing levels have decreased from the previous year, we have slightly reduced service and will operate one less bus daily. This amounts to roughly a 9.5% decrease in service. As a result, we have shifted more residential runs (WS, DCL) to direct UDC service to ensure the same or more frequent service to/from the UDC as in previous semesters. We hope to return service frequency to previous numbers in the following semesters as we replenish our staffing levels in upcoming training classes.

					<br><br> All other runs will continue operating at frequencies similar to previous semesters. However, certain run times may have changed – please visit occtransport.org/pages/routeschedule for the most up-to-date schedules.

					<br><br>OCCT is currently taking applications for our Fall 2 Training class! If you're 18 or older, had a U.S. driver's license for at least one year, with no active violations or points, apply to drive the iconic blue buses! Visit occtransport.org/pages/employment for more information.

					<br><br>As we get into the semester, please remember to scan your ID when boarding the bus, and follow all rules of riding the bus. We look forward to another semester of providing you with safe, courteous, and reliable transportation. Best of luck in the semester, and thank you for continuing to be what makes OCCT so great!

					<br><br>For more information regarding the changes noted, please visit occtransport.org, or visit occtransport.org/pages/contactus to ask any questions.
