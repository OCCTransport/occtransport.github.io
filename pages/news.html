							<span class="busBlue-color">8/8/2025: Fall 2025 Semester Schedules & Service Bulletin</span>
						</h3>
					</div>
						<div class="container-info">
						<p>
							Welcome to the Fall 2025 Semester, Bearcats! OCC Transport is excited to be back to full service, with some improvements and new additions to make your commute better this semester.
							<br><br>
							OCCT is proud to introduce its newly extended and improved routes: Vestal Shopping Shuttle (VS), Oakdale Commons Shuttle (OC), and Downtown Southside (DS) Inbound!
							<br><br>
							Formerly known as the Rivera Ridge Town Square Mall Shuttle (RRT), the RRT has been renamed the Vestal Shopping Shuttle (VS). It now follows the same route as before, including stops at favorites like Target and Walmart, but with an extended route. Additionally, The Shoppes at Vestal and Campus Plaza are now key destinations. The entire route takes 45 minutes, and <b><u>ALL VS OUTBOUNDS DEPART FROM THE UNION, NOT RAFUSE.</u></b>
							<br><br>
							The Oakdale Commons Shuttle (OC) has also been extended. After servicing the Oakdale Commons and Wegmans stops, it continues to stop at Aldi on Harry L Drive and at Five Below. The total trip takes about 35 minutes, with <b><u>ALL OC OUTBOUNDS DEPARTING FROM THE UNION, NOT RAFUSE.</u></b>
							<br><br>
							The demand for bus service in Binghamton’s Southside neighborhood has grown significantly over the past few semesters; however, OCCT was unable to meet that demand earlier due to a labor shortage. When the Downtown Southside (DS) Outbound route was introduced last year, it only operated after 6 P.M. with four runs each night. Now, on weekdays, the DS Outbound starts at 7 A.M., and the newly DS Inbound begins at 8 A.M., totaling 31 DS runs each weekday!
							<br><br>
							As we begin the semester, please remember to <b><u>scan your ID</u></b> when boarding and follow all bus rules and regulations. This ensures that you’re BU-affiliated for the driver and helps OCCT expand service accordingly with accurate ridership data. Drivers will remind passengers to scan IDs over the first few weeks and <b><u>may deny boarding if an ID cannot be presented.</u></b>
							<br><br>
							OCCT is now accepting applications for our Fall 2 Training class! If you're 18 or older, have had a U.S. driver's license for at least a year, and have no active violations or points, apply to become a driver of our iconic blue buses! Visit occtransport.org/pages/employment for more details.
							<br><br>
							We look forward to providing you with another semester of safe, courteous, and reliable transportation. Best of luck this semester, and thank you for making OCCT great!
							<br><br>
							For more details on these changes, please visit occtransport.org or go to occtransport.org/pages/contactus to ask questions.

					<p>
						Welcome to the Spring 2025 Semester, Bearcats! We hope you had a restful winter break and an enjoyable holiday season. OCC Transport is happy to be back running with improvements and updates to service.
						<br><br>
						Our drive for recruitment has allowed us to replenish staffing levels enough to increase service hours by approximately 9.7% this semester! In particular, an additional 8 DCL Inbounds have been added on weekdays, and each downtown route has seen an increase in frequency throughout the week. The same routes operated last semester will continue this semester. The start of the DS Inbound operation has been postponed as we continue to research housing and ridership data in the Southside.
						<br><br>
						Certain peak inbound buses in the morning that are prone to getting full will also have additional “chaser” buses that will pick up remaining passengers on Main St. after Chestnut St. after the first bus gets full. Certain WS, DCL, MS, and UDC Inbounds will still be <b>skipping Academic A</b>to avoid traffic congestion around West Drive during class changes. Please review the schedules for each inbound route to see which specific runs will skip Academic A.
						<br><br>
						We would also like to courteously remind you a valid Binghamton University ID is required to ride and <b>must be presented and scanned each time you board</b>. This ensures that you're BU-affiliated for the driver and helps OCCT expand service accordingly with accurate ridership data. When boarding, please have your ID out before approaching the steps to prevent delays. Drivers will remind passengers to scan IDs when boarding for the first few weeks and reserve the right to deny boarding if an ID cannot be presented.
						<br><br>
						OCCT is currently taking applications for our Spring 2 Training class! If you're 18 or older, had a U.S. driver's license for at least one year, with no active violations or points, apply to drive the iconic blue buses! Visit occtransport.org/pages/employment for more information.
						<br><br>
						As always, please remember to follow the rules when riding and be courteous to our drivers and fellow passengers. We look forward to another semester of providing safe, courteous, and reliable transportation. Best of luck in the semester, and thank you for continuing to be what makes OCCT so great!

					Welcome to the Fall 2024 Semester, Bearcats! OCC Transport is happy to be back running full service with some improvements and additions to service for you this semester. <br> <br>

					OCCT is proud to introduce a new route, the Downtown Southside (DS)! This route provides service between Main Campus and the UDC via Southside neighborhoods and Downtown Binghamton. This semester, it will only run in the Outbound direction (Campus to UDC) in the evening hours when BC Transit stops operating the 5. As we increase staffing levels and review passenger demand, a mirrored Inbound run will begin operating in the following semesters. Visit occtransport.org/pages/ds for more information!

					<br> <br> <b>Since the release of the Downtown Southside, we will no longer be operating the Leroy Southside (LRS). </b>Being the oldest route in our roster, operating since the early 1990s, this route’s service area is currently covered by other routes throughout our service hours and therefore defunct.  

					<br> <br> Since our staffing levels have decreased from the previous year, we have slightly reduced service and will operate one less bus daily. This amounts to roughly a 9.5% decrease in service. As a result, we have shifted more residential runs (WS, DCL) to direct UDC service to ensure the same or more frequent service to/from the UDC as in previous semesters. We hope to return service frequency to previous numbers in the following semesters as we replenish our staffing levels in upcoming training classes.

					<br><br> All other runs will continue operating at frequencies similar to previous semesters. However, certain run times may have changed – please visit occtransport.org/pages/routeschedule for the most up-to-date schedules.

					<br><br>OCCT is currently taking applications for our Fall 2 Training class! If you're 18 or older, had a U.S. driver's license for at least one year, with no active violations or points, apply to drive the iconic blue buses! Visit occtransport.org/pages/employment for more information.

					<br><br>As we get into the semester, please remember to scan your ID when boarding the bus, and follow all rules of riding the bus. We look forward to another semester of providing you with safe, courteous, and reliable transportation. Best of luck in the semester, and thank you for continuing to be what makes OCCT so great!

					<br><br>For more information regarding the changes noted, please visit occtransport.org, or visit occtransport.org/pages/contactus to ask any questions.
