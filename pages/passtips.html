                          <li>To find the route nearest to you and its schedule, please refer to our routes and schedules page <a href="routeschedule.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
                          <li><b style="color: #2596be;">Please Note:</b> Weekday and Weekend Service differs, double check you are reading the correct schedule.</li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Know when your bus is scheduled to arrive and be at the stop 5-10 minutes beforehand.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Wait at designated bus stops only. For your safety buses may only board or alight passengers at designated stops.</li>
                      <li>Since other people may be waiting for a different bus please be attentive for your bus, and flag the bus driver down to indicate that you would like to board.</li>
                      <li>Have your BU ID card out and ready to scan prior to boarding the bus.
                        <ul>
                          <li>Unsure of how to scan your ID on the bus? Ask your driver!</li>
                        </ul>

                  </li>
                  <li>Board at the front door only, unless told otherwise by the driver.</li>
                  <li>Do not stand forward of the white line in the front of the bus. This is a federal safety regulation to allow the bus driver a clear field of vision.</li>
                  <li>Move to the rear of the bus after boarding, so that as many as possible may board the bus.</li>
                  <li>Pull the stop request cord to signal the driver that you would like to exit at the next stop.</li>
                  <li>Exit at the rear door. This will expedite the boarding of passengers.</li>
                  <li>Do not cross in front of the bus after exiting. Wait until the bus has pulled away from the bus stop and you have a clear field of vision in both directions before crossing the street.</li>
